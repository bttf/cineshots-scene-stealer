## Reddit /r/CineShots Image Saving App Thing

This hacky piece of code will fetch a specified number of pages worth of images posted on [/r/Cineshots](http://reddit.com/r/cineshots) and save them in the local project dir..

I'm saving this for later reference and possibly building it out into something DECENT. For the moment it will remain hacky and untested. Use at your own risk.
